- make clauses be allocated in chunks (4 lits or so)
- recycle allocated chunks
- always refer to clauses (instead of w/ pointers) by index, which is a "smart"
  pointer that encodes whether the clause is binary (so you don't have to fetch
  the clause to know)

* change in progress
- change the watchlists to a new, cache-friendly structure DONE
- change bin watchers so all the clause stuff is in the binwatch head DONE
- in order to do this, I need to change the clauses (they're currently doubly
  linked) AND the unit facts, so I may as well changes the clauses at the same
  time. DONE
- therefore, I'm changing clauses to remove the implicit watching list and the
  id. that's it. DONE

* adjust litPos so it's modular

* next change
- change the clause repr so it is allocated in blocks with part of it stored in
  the head
- add hook for deciding variable phase in decision
